# linked-lists

This project was meant to help us understand the concept of a linked list. This is a list in which each list node has a property that names the next list node, thus linking the list together.
My code contains a node module and a linkedlist module. Each node module contains a value and a nextNode property. The linked list includes various methods insert, delete, and manipulate linked list nodes.
